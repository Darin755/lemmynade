# Lemmynade

A fork of the original lemmur app we all knew and loved. It was unfortunately abandoned but this project aims to keep the legacy it started.

## How to Install
- Currently there are no binary downloads available as this is just the start of this fork. However, you can reference the old readme [here](README.md.old).
